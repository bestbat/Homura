# Tweaks

This is the tweaks site here i store tweaks for some games.

# Borderlands 2

The game dont start if this game gets started over steam, but works if you start the "Borderlands2.exe" with steam in the background.

`WINEPREFIX='/home/$USER/Games/Steam' wine '/home/$USER/Games/Steam/drive_c/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Borderlands 2/Binaries/Win32/Borderlands2.exe`

# SUPERHOT

Here i guess steam picks the wrong exe, because SUPERHOT.exe crashs but SH.exe not.

`WINEPREFIX='/home/$USER/Games/Steam' wine '/home/$USER/Games/Steam/drive_c/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/SUPERHOT/SH.exe'`
