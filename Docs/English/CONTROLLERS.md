Here is a list of controllers that we have tested.

First of all, we think the most controllers controller only work in applications that are using SDL.

# Stean Controller

Don't work...

# All Xbox involved controllers

Xbox/360/One/One-S/Xplorer etc... dont work.

# Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar (PC) & Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Les Paul (PS3)

Works, but the tool [x11/antimicro](https://www.freshports.org/x11/antimicro/) is needed to map the buttons.
