Here is a list of controllers that we have tested.

First of all, we think the most controllers controller only work in applications that are using SDL.

# Stean Controller

Don't work...

# All Xbox involved controllers

Xbox/360/One/One-S/Xplorer etc... dont work.

# Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar

Works, but the tool [x11/antimicro](https://www.freshports.org/x11/antimicro/) is need to map the buttons.
