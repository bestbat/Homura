# Introduction :microphone:

Inspired by [Lutris](https://github.com/lutris/lutris), we would like to provide a game launcher to play Windows games on FreeBSD.

# Description &#x1F4D8;

Homura is a launcher that makes it easy to run Windows games/launcher easily on FreeBSD by providing the requiered fixes and workarounds.

The Windows emulation is provided by [Wine](https://www.winehq.org).

# Installation/Uninstallation :cd:

### Installing from FreeBSD repository üì¶

Note: Packages can lag behind ports. If you want the latest version you may want to use the `latest` repository instead of `quarterly` or build the package yourself.

`# pkg install games/homura`

### Build & installing the port ‚öôÔ∏è

`cd /usr/ports/games/homura/ && make install clean`

### Uninstallation

`# pkg uninstall games/homura`

To also delete the related games etc...

Use the "Delete and reset everything" function.

# Usage :computer:

Homura was created for the gui usage in the first place, the gui can be opened via the commandline `Homura` but also via a shortcut (if you have Homura allowed to create one).

For terminal fans there are also some fast commands:

Examples: 

- To install something use `Homura Install  Steam`
- To launch something use `Homura Launch Steam`
- To uninstall something use `Homura Uninstall Steam`
- To open winetricks in a prefix use `Homura Winetricks Steam`

# Feature / To-Do list

Features | Done?
------------ | -------------
Installation launching & uninstallation of our collection of applications | :heavy_check_mark:
Custom prefixes | :heavy_check_mark:
Shortcut creation | :heavy_check_mark:

# Limitations :x:

- Only 32-Bit Games and Applications working currently. You may want to see https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=242625
- No winevulkan for 32bit Wine on amd64. Reason: There are no options to build i386-wine-devel with vulkan.

# Chat :speech_balloon:

You need help, want to help or just want to talk?

No fear we don't bite ;)
